    "Product name: GrokVid.ai (AI Video Generator SaaS).",
    "SaaS structure: public pages + authenticated app pages (/dashboard, /create, /library, /editor, /billing, /settings).",
    "Core flow: prompt -> generate video -> edit -> download.",
    "Library must support video status (processing/ready) and actions (download/delete).",
    "Billing model uses credits and tiered plans (Free/Creator/Pro), with watermark/resolution differences.",
    "Payments planned via Stripe (global) + Razorpay (India) with webhooks to refill credits.",
    "AI pipeline is asynchronous and should use a queue system for jobs (e.g., BullMQ/Redis or SQS equivalent).",
    "Planned services: text->video (Runway/Pika/SVD), text->image (Stable Diffusion), voice (ElevenLabs), lipsync (Wav2Lip), LLM prompt enhancement.",
    "Internet Computer stack constraint: avoid external LLM API calls for emotion detection; implement deterministic rules-based classifier on frontend (TypeScript) and send emotion-annotated scene objects to backend."
